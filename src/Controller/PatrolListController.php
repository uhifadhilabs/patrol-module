/**
 * THE FULL LOG — every patrol the month holds, uncapped, which is the one thing
 * the dashboard's log card cannot be: a card that grew with the data would make
 * a busy month a page nobody can read.
 *
 * IT IS A DATA PLACE, so it is one of the module's two tabs, and its detail
 * screens light it — see {@see \Uhifadhi\Patrol\Shell\PatrolModuleTabs}.
 *
 * LEAN, like every controller here: it reads the one filter out of the query,
 * asks the repository for the month and hands both to the service that decides
 * what is on screen. No base class — a reusable bundle's controller takes what
 * it needs in its constructor and is wired explicitly, exactly as
 * FrameworkBundle's own TemplateController is.
 *
