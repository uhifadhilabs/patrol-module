/*
 * The bundle's static service wiring.
 *
 * PHP (not YAML) on purpose: a reusable bundle must not force symfony/yaml onto
 * hosts, and FQCN references stay refactor-safe and phpstan-checked. Imported by
 * UhifadhiLabsPatrolBundle::loadExtension(), which keeps only the config-DRIVEN
 * definitions (module category, vocabulary parameters).
 *
 * Everything below is defined EXPLICITLY — no autowire(), no autoconfigure(), and
 * ids prefixed with the bundle alias — because this bundle is installed by other
 * projects via Composer, which is what Symfony calls a reusable bundle:
 *
 *   "Services should not use autowiring or autoconfiguration. Instead, all
 *    services should be defined explicitly."
 *   "If the bundle defines services, they must be prefixed with the bundle alias."
 *   — https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/best_practices.html
 *
 * Controllers extend nothing and take their collaborators explicitly, patterned
 * on FrameworkBundle's own TemplateController (see
 * vendor/symfony/framework-bundle/Controller/TemplateController.php).
